    <h1>I'm Missy, a beginner and aspiring PoweRapper. Here is where I display such pretty HTML elements.</h1>
    <hr>
    An hr tag creates a line to separate things in such a pretty way. Oh, and this is an open tag which means there is no closing tag which means there is one fewer thing to remember, yay!
    <hr>
  <h1>h1 is the main heading</h1>
    <h2>h2 is the first subheading</h2>
    <h3>h3 is the second subheading</h3>
    <h4>h4 is the third subheading</h4>
    <h5>h5 is the fourth subheading</h5>
    <h6>h6 is the fifth and smallest subheading (isn't it so cute?)</h6>
    <p>p is a p tag which stands for paragraph element and is what is used for body text</p>
	<hr>
    <p>Email input:<input type="email" placeholder="Your email">
      
      <p>This is what I call the magic element:
<br>
the input element. This displays an input type="that displays a" placeholder="where text disappears as you begin to type in some cool stuff!"</p>


placeholder text, and the text actually disappears when the user types in whatever it is they want to type:<input type="text" placeholder="Your name">
      
      <p>Submit input and shows up as a button (I <strong>love</strong> buttons): 
    <input type="submit">
        
	<h2>Pretty Form</h2>
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Did you know you could make a section by outlining it?</legend>
        <label><input id="yes" type="radio" name="yes-no" value="yes"> Yes</label>
        <label><input id="no" type="radio" name="yes-no" value="no"> No</label>
        </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>You wouldn't be lying, would you?</legend>
      <input id="Yes.." type="checkbox"> Yes..

<h3>Here are three really great resources for learning html:</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#element-content-categories">HTML Living Standard by WHATWG</a></li>I dare you find something more thorough than this :-X (btw, remember when we had to make our own emojis with our keyboard?)

<li><a href="">w3 Schools</a></li>

<li><a href="">mdn/Mozilla</li>

        		<p>Things I like about this website:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It loads fast.</li>
			<li>It supports dark mode</li>
			<li>Otherwise nothing really.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<script type="text/javascript">
		function greet() {
			alert("Oh! I didn't see you there. Don't mind me while I showcase the cool things I learn everyday.. on my website.. where you weren't invited.. Wait, who are you again?")
		}
		// Let's hope visitors won't find the popup annoying. And if they do, who cares? 
		window.onload = greet;
		</script>
